  The distance between the simulated value and the observed value is used to
    quantitatively evaluate the overall performance of differentmodels to the
    reference model. The overall performance of different models to the
    reference model can be quantified.The distance combines different 
    statistical measures of correlation coefficient, absolute error and root
    mean square error, namely CCHZ-DISO.
